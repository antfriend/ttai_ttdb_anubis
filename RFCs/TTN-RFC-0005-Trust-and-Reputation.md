# TTN-RFC-0005
## Trust, Reputation, and Social Gravity
### Version 1.0

Status: Stable

This RFC defines decentralized trust modeling for TTN.

---

## 1. Trust Model
Trust is local, subjective, and non-global.

---

## 2. Trust Signals
- Seen frequency
- Edge corroboration
- Signature validity
- Behavior history

---

## 3. Reputation Gravity
Nodes with more trusted edges exert higher semantic gravity,
making their events more likely to propagate.

---

## 4. Moderation
Edges:
- trusted_by
- muted_by
- blocked_by
- rehabilitated_by
